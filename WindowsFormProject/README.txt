-- please reference the NewImport branch for the most up to date commits 

--- NAVIGATING FILES ---
VetDataBase contains all sql scripts
WIndowsFormProject contains GUI for application

The dbo file under VetDatabase contains Stored Procedures and Tables
Import Data contains all insert statements

--- USING THE APPLICATION ---
Press one of the menu strip items to get started.

When searching:
pressing 'search pets' 'search owners' and 'search vets' while the search bar is empty will pull up a list of all existing table entries
for those respective categories

The search name must match exactly a pet/owner/vet's first or last name (capitals don't matter).
You can also search owners by email

You must hit the submit buttons on any filled forms for them to work.

Killing a pet or firing a vet removes them from being searchable, however they still exist in the database to contribute to statistics
